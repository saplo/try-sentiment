Quick Start
------------

1) Download project
2. Get Saplo API keys: http://saplo.com/signup 
2) Open terminal and 'cd' into the project directory.
3) Run: java -jar target/try-sentiment-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --apikey=YOURAPIKEY --secretkey=YOURSECRETKEY
4) Check output.csv file for result


Slightly more advanced
------------------------

The application takes the texts stored in target/input.csv. 
You can change the text, though it is important you use the following structure:

"text","target_word"

Note: Don't have any spaces between , and " because then the CSV parser will break.

Build from source
------------------
mvn assembly:single
